                <p>A business is not just an economic entity in society but also has a moral obligation to the community. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a broad concept that encompasses a company's responsibility to generate profit, adhere to legal obligations towards shareholders, and protect the rights of employees, consumers, communities, and the environment. CRC Solar is fully committed to achieving these social goals not only in Vietnam but globally.</p>
